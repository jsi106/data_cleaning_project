# Data Cleaning Course Project

The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
Included in this project are three files
1. result.tsv - the result of running run_analysis.r on original data set
2. CodeBook.md - describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
3. run_analysis.r will performs the following tasks on the original data set.
	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
	5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
